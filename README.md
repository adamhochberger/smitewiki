### What this website will hopefully do: 
- Make information more accessible and easier to consume for new users and veterans, alike
- Allow users to build and see the stats associated with certain item builds and buffs applied to their god

#### Stretch goal:
- Add a DPS calculator that can more easily show how characters perform in certain environments, lowering the need for the in-game practice tool

### What this website will not do:
- Display match history, or other user-specific information, with a potential exception for pro or user-submitted builds
- Show elo, or matchmaking rating
-
